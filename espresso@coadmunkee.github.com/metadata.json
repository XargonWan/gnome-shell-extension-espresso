  "description": "Espresso provides multiple options to control disabling auto suspend and screensaver functionality and optionally Night Light. Show an Espresso icon in the top panel that can be clicked to enable or disable Espresso or use a hotkey to toggle the state. Additional options can be set to enable Espresso when specific application are running or when any fullscreen application is running, pause Night Light when Espresso is enabled or only when specific applications are running, restore state across reboots, and provide notifications. Espresso also supports some functions for docking stations to enable Espresso when charging and/or when docked to external monitors and to allow temporarily overriding the docking support without affecting the stored state.\n\nPlease visit the Extension Homepage to leave feedback or report issues.",
